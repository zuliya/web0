Backend
NodeJS Server accessing
Gonna send data

Front end gonna request from server
Server will request to API
Server is middle man btw API n user


Use javascript + mysl ( GOOGLE)


Start creating incredibly simple server  ( app.get (“/“ search)  test localhost:8090/
test them in the browser

2.  Make a Basic Front end (bootstrap ) Strat up with the text box and a button
Have the form and get it submitting to a server

That is with some JQuery front end ./ user interaction
JQuery talk to nodes so nodeJs could give some dummy data
(server return the same thing every time )

( have my form submitting to the server)


3. Set up the database / or add more routes (get events ) to
for each route either get  (read data) or post (putting things you got from these to the database)
(get ) NodeJs routes
route is anything that comes after your domain name
( post venues / get venues)
Express is the node module that allows you to nicely create a server

nom ( initialise a package.json) which modules
install express in the local

folder to be in
npm init
nom install express —save(put it in package ..
